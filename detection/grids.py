# 1. run a crude circle detection on the image
# 2. get the average radius of the detected circles
# 3. update the average radius and keep running until it converges
# 4. use the converged radius to run a more accurate circle detection
# 5. convert each circle into a rectangular grid item
# 6. sort the items into rows and columns
