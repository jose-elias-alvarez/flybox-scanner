# this class is responsible for detecting a grid of items
# the basic algorithm is as follows:
# 1. run a crude circle detection on the image
# 2. get the average radius of the detected circles
# 3. update the average radius and keep running until it converges
# 4. use the converged radius to run a more accurate circle detection
# 5. convert each circle into a rectangular grid item
# 6. sort the items into rows and columns

# ideally, this should have adjustable trackbars to allow for easy tuning,
# but for now you can have fun playing around with the constants below
