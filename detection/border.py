import cv2

# this class crops a given frame to the area of interest
# this is desirable because it essentially increases the usable area of the video,
# making everything more accurate without increasing processing time

# since the inside of the flybox is dark, we use a simple threshold
# 0 is absolute black, 255 is absolute white
# if the frame is still too large, we can set this to a higher value
# (which should be pretty safe, since the area of interest is so bright)
